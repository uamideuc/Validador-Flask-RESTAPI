**Current Status**: ✅ Basic protection via single institutional key  
**Consideration**: Implement request rate limiting per IP address  
**Impact**: Would prevent brute force attempts on institutional key  
**Recommendation**: Low priority - single key model already limits attack surface

#### 2. **Audit Logging** (Optional Enhancement)
**Current Status**: ✅ Security event monitoring active  
**Consideration**: Comprehensive audit trail for all user actions  
**Impact**: Enhanced compliance and forensic capabilities  
**Recommendation**: Medium priority - implement if compliance requirements exist

#### 3. **Multi-Factor Authentication** (Optional Enhancement)
**Current Status**: ✅ Single factor (institutional key) appropriate for use case  
**Consideration**: Time-based OTP or hardware tokens  
**Impact**: Additional security layer but increased complexity  
**Recommendation**: Low priority - current model fits institutional use case

#### 4. **Content Security Policy Hardening** (Optional Enhancement)
**Current Status**: ✅ Basic CSP implemented  
**Consideration**: Stricter CSP with nonce-based script loading  
**Impact**: Enhanced XSS protection
